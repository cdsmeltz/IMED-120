Final Project 2 for Chad Smeltz.

The object of the game is to hover your mouse over the circle on the screen 50 times before 60 seconds runs out!

The controls of the game involve moving the mouse around to the out edge of the circle. The moment the circle is touched, it will increase the score by one and will "teleport" to a random space on the map, waiting to be touched again.

This process will continue to occur until: WIN: Score reaches 50 before timer reaches 0 LOSS/GAME OVER: Score is less than 50 when timer reaches 0


ADDITIONS TO FINAL PROJECT II:

-Created a menu with a "Start Game" functionality that allows the user to make the timer start from 60, thus starting the game
-Finalized "Reset Score" button to reset score in addition to restarting the timer
-Added Green Victory/Win screen if user hits 50 points, makes it very easy to see
-Changed Defeat/Loss text
-Changed game to be playable for 1 minute, up from 30 seconds
-Changed text on goal of the game to fit new timer

Final Project 1 for Chad Smeltz.

The object of the game is to hover your mouse over the circle on the screen 40 times before 30 seconds runs out!

The controls of the game involve moving the mouse around to the out edge of the circle. The moment the circle is touched, it will increase the score by one and will "teleport" to a random space on the map, waiting to be touched again. 

This process will continue to occur until: 
WIN: Score reaches 40 before timer reaches 0
LOSS/GAME OVER: Score is less than 40 when timer reaches 0

I've created both a victory screen and a game over screen so that the player knows whether or not they've made it within the alotted time.
